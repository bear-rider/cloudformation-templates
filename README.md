A collection of CloudFormation templates.

Each directory has it's own `README.md` with documentation on deploying the CloudFormation stack.

**Warning**: As of January 2020, I am no longer adding to this repository, as I believe [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) will be the preferred technology for declarative infrastructure moving forward. That said, if you need assistance with any of these CloudFormation stacks, simply open an [issue](https://github.com/NickolasHKraus/cloudformation-templates/issues).
